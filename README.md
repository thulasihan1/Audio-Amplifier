# Audio-Amplifier
This Audio Amplifier Circuit is created on a PCB using the Eagle CAD software. The circuit takes input from the microphone or the AUX In from a laptop or phone. Based on the the Volume Adjustments from the 10k pot, the LM386 will provide volume amplification and the the Vout will be projected onto a speaker or AUX out device. The quad Comparator (LM339N) and 4 LEDS are represented as a "Volume Level Indicator".  Based on the Vout from the LM386, the LEDs will turn ON or OFF. 


A further analysis on the circuit, schematic of circuit, and a working project video is in the repository.
